            <p>Hi, I am Adam and I am a developer originally from San Francisco.  
                I spent my childhood in the city and then moved around the Bay Area, experiencing both city
                and farm life.
              After four years at UC Santa Cruz, I worked
                in finance where I had the opportunity to help people save money, grow their businesses, and finance projects that improved the lives of many people.
                It wasn't until more recently that I realized I could make an even greater positive impact in the community through software engineering, which prompted 
                me to attend Rithm School, a San Francisco based full-stack software engineering program.           

            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy the problem solving aspects that software engineering has to offer, and am always thinking of
                ways I can harness
                my technological skills to make a greater impact and improve the lives of others.
            </p>

            <p>Outside of software, I love cooking, exercising, reading, and traveling.  Most recently, I have travelled to Japan and Thailand and I 
                am looking to exploring Europe next.
            </p>
