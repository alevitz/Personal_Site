                Hi, I'm Adam.  I'm a developer originally from San Francisco with a passion for building applications that will improve the lives of others.
                After graduating from UC Santa Cruz, I worked
                in finance where I had the opportunity to help hundreds of people improve their finances and grow their businesses.
            </p>    
                <p>
                It wasn't until more recently that I had an affinity for problem solving and building things and  
                 realized I could leverage these interests through software engineering.  This prompted
                me to attend Rithm School, a San Francisco based full-stack software engineering program, in order to jump start my software engineering career.   
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of software, I enjoy cooking, exercising, reading, photography, and traveling. Most recently, I have travelled
                to Japan and Thailand and
                am looking to explore Europe next.  
            </p>
